# owslib.net

## Motivation
- Primarily we're interested in a generic WFS client class that can work for us in a number of Windows-based applications
- Shouldn't there already be something like this? They did it for Python already: [OWSLib for Python](http://owslib.sourceforge.net/)

### Work in progress!
